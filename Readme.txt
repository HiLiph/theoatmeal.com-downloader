Python Script to download all comics from theoatmeal.com

It downloads each comic to seperate folder "OatmealComics/ComicName" where ComicName is the name of the comic.
It DOES NOT download comics which are already downloaded, incase you run the script again.

Usage is as follows:

Just run the python script. No input is taken from the user.
Requires BeautifulSoup to run.
